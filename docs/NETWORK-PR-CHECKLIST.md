# Network PR checklist

Before merging network-related work:

```text
[ ] Which production domain(s) must change?
[ ] Did I push the repo that Vercel deploys for that domain?
[ ] Lender apex changes → this standalone repo (Lender-Trust-Hub) commit exists
[ ] Bumped ASK_NETWORK_STANDARD_VERSION if chrome/journey contract changed
[ ] After deploy: npm run smoke:network (from Move-trust-Hub) or curl list in NETWORK-DEPLOY.md
```

Full rules: [NETWORK-DEPLOY.md](./NETWORK-DEPLOY.md)
